"""`bad no-source-claim-gate` — block a report that claims an absence its own corpus fills.

Thin shell over `checks.no_source_claim`: no ranking, no rewriting, no LLM. The
enumeration line goes out first on both paths, so a run that found nothing still
reports how many notes it read and how many absence claims it examined — the
difference between an honest clean and a gate that never looked.

Exit 1 when there are findings, 0 when clean, 2 when the inputs could not be
read (an unreadable input must never be mistaken for a pass).
